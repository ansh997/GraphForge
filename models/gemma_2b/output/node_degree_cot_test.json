G describes a graph among nodes 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6.\nThe edges in G are: (0, 1) (1, 2) (2, 3) (3, 4) (4, 5) (5, 6).\nQ: What is the degree of node 1?\nA: \n\n Just provide me the answer. your output should not contain any conversation. Give me just one word answer wherever necessary and nothing else.\n\nThe degree of node 8 is 7."
